## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. **Open the Application:** 
   Once installed, launch the power-output-prediction-ann application.

2. **Load Your Data:**
   Click on the 'Load Data' button. Choose an appropriate CSV file containing historical data of a combined cycle power plant. The file should have columns for temperature, pressure, humidity, and other relevant features.

3. **Start the Prediction:**
   After loading your data, select 'Run Prediction'. The application will preprocess the data, train the model, and then display the results.

4. **Visualize Results:**
   You can find a visualization tab that offers graphs and charts based on the predictions. This helps in understanding performance and trends.
